        <p>Welcome to our experiment! 4 people, that is you and 3 others will be matched in a group. Group members will remain the same during the experiment.</p>

        <p><strong>  PART 1:</strong><br /> Your task in this part is to count the number of zeros in as many tables as possible. You have 2 minutes to do this task. You earn 1 point for a correct counted table. After the task, you and your fellow participants will be ranked according to earning points. 2 people with the highest possible points get 40 coins and the remaining 2 people get 20 coins. In case of ties, ranking will be randomly determined.</p>

        <p><strong> PART 2:</strong><br /> </p>

        <p><strong>Your endowment:</strong><br /> Your endowment is your earning coins in PART 1 </p>

        <p><strong>Your contribution:</strong><br />Each round, you will have to choose how many coins to put directly into your <b>personal account</b>, and how many coins to put into a <b>group account</b>.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from <b>personal account</b>:</strong><br /> Each coin that you put into your <b>personal account</b> goes one-to-one towards your payoff.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from the <b>group account</b>:</strong><br /> Each coin that you and other group members put into the <b>group account</b> will pay you back 0.25 coins.</p>

        <p><strong>Payoff:</strong><br />Your payoff will be equal to: <b>Your Endowment - Your Contribution + Return from the group account</b>.</p>

        <p><strong>Total return:</strong><br />ONE round will be randomly chosen from 4 paying rounds of the experiment. Each round has an equal chance of being chosen, therefore, you should make your decisions carefully in every round. The coins for the round chosen will be converted to money at a rate of 100 coins per USD .</p>
